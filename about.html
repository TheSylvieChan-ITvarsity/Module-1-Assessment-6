    <p class="aboutbio">We are a small sole proprietorship who is passionate about making high quality and affordable plushies for our local South-Africans.
        <br><br>Finding good quality
         plushies nowadays can be a daunting task, and more often than not we receive sub-par products that seem to fall apart at the seams.
         <br><br>We took it upon ourselves to do better and to provide our local community with the quality they deserve.<br><br>Established quite literally yesterday, we are driven to give our customers the utmost assurance that we are reputable and eager to get our
        collective feet through the door of e-commerce. Our infrastructure may be small but we are committed to growing our business and establishing a loyal customer base.
